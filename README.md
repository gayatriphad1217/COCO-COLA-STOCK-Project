# COCO-COLA-STOCK-Project
A stock analysis project using Python and ML
🧠 Problem Statement
Coca-Cola is one of the most iconic companies globally, and its stock performance is of great interest to investors, analysts, and market researchers. Analyzing historical stock data can provide valuable insights into trends, patterns, and predictions for future performance. The problem is to build a robust system that can:

Analyze historical Coca-Cola stock data.

Visualize key financial trends.

Engineer features to enhance model predictions.

Apply machine learning algorithms to predict future stock prices.

This project aims to help investors make more informed decisions by leveraging data science techniques.

📊 Project Description
This project is a complete end-to-end analysis and modeling of Coca-Cola's stock performance using historical data. The major steps include:

🔹 1. Data Collection
Dataset: Coca-Cola stock historical data (downloaded from Yahoo Finance or Kaggle)

🔹 2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Parsed the Date column, handled missing values, and cleaned inconsistencies in the data.

🔹 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized trends such as stock closing prices, daily returns, and moving averages using matplotlib and seaborn.

🔹 4. Feature Engineering
Extracted new features from the Date column (Year, Month, Day).

Calculated rolling means and other technical indicators.

🔹 5. Model Building
Trained a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest) to predict the stock’s future closing prices based on historical features.

🔹 6. Evaluation
Measured performance using RMSE and plotted actual vs. predicted values.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

💡 Future Enhancements
Integrate LSTM (deep learning) for better time series prediction.

Deploy using Streamlit for interactive visualization.

Auto-update stock data via API (e.g., Yahoo Finance API or Alpha Vantage).
